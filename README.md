Project Lotsawa - automatic translation of Tibetan text
You can see an example here http://Lotsawa.pythonanywhere.com/
Who is interested to collaborate, support the project, welcome.

## Module 1 Text (Python)
1.1 Formats Tibetan text (labels: headings, subheadings, quotations, non-tibetan text; divides into paragraphs, internally labels sentences for further translation)

## Module 2 Dictionary (Python)
2.1 Splits into words
2.2 Searches word in dictionary (PickleDB) collects found words and all their meanings into a mini dictionary.
2.3 Generates an output file (can be viewed here - http://Lotsawa.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Module 3 Word (JavaScript+Python)
3.1 Clicking on a word in the tibetan text shows the word's translation card.
3.1.1 Translations are rated in % by frequency of occurrence (in development).
3.1.2 In the card you can select translation relevant in this context or add your translation (by pressing ‚ò∏) (added translation with Tibetan key goes to the list of 'New Pair' and PickleDB and 00_NW.txt).
3.1.3 On the right side of the 'Word' tab type Tibetan word combination => Russian translation (press ‚ò∏) a new pair is added | replaced (checkbox= replace) (the added pair goes to the list of 'New Pair' and PickleDB and 00_NW.txt)
3.1.4 On the right side of the Word tab you type the Tibetan phrase (by pressing ‚ò∏) to request the dictionary entry from the PickleDB dictionary

## Module 4 Sentence / Text (JavaScript+Python)
4.1 After selecting (in the card of word) all (at least one) meanings of the words in the sentence, a technical auto-translation of the sentence is displayed which can be edited.
4.1.1 part of speech of each word (in development)
4.1.2 the most frequent translations or your choice from section 3.1.2 can be swapped to form a technical translation of the sentence. 
4.1.3 Box for literary translation of a sentence (can be done by editing the technical translation)
4.1.4 The acceptable sentence translation, together with the Tibetan original, (by pressing ‚ò∏) is saved in PickleDB and 03_ST.txt and appended to the Translated Text (in the right side window).
4.1.5 On the right side of the Text tab type a passage of Tibetan text (press ‚ò∏) to obtain a parse of this passage of Tibetan text

## Module 5 File(JavaScript+Python)
5.1 On the right side of the File tab you can specify a user file and (by pressing ‚ò∏) obtain the parsing of the Tibetan text and ready to translate 

## Module 6 Control Buttons (JavaScript+Python)
5.1 ‚öô - Settings: User selection, languages of interface etc.
5.2 „èà - Exporting modified PickleDB to BackUpDB
5.3 ‚èÆ‚è≠ - Page navigation
